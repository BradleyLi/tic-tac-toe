1. I started with the UI/UX design of the game. This part is not particularly difficult as the overall logic of the game tic-tac-toe is fairly straighforward.
2. The first obstacle occurs when I was implementing rendering the crosses and circles onto the board in an alternating order. I realized that my pieces can overwrite each other when in fact it should not
be allowed. I googled the DOM function(not through AI) that checks the presence of children node and fixed the issue by adding an if statement that checks if there already exists a piece in a particular
cell and only allows placing a piece on an unoccupied position.
3. The layout styling of the game is slightly challenging as well in the sense that it takes a lot of
time to adjust it to make it look perfect.
4. Later when I was writing the winning check function, which is not hard neither but does take quite some time to write because there are many conditions that need to be check for the 4 by 4 board. I choose to add the 4 by 4 board to add complexties and variations to the original game.
5. The true challenge come with rendering the line crossing the winning three pieces. The challenge comes from two parts: first, locate the starting and ending coordinates; secondly, somehow get it onto the board. I thought over it for some time but still couldn't think of a good idea to do so. I thus resorted to ChatGPT and entered the following prompt "How to dynamically draw a winning line across any row, column, or diagonal in a tic-tac-toe game". It generated me a suggestive solution which I fine tuned to make it work for my program. After seeing the solution generated by AI, I realized that there is some knowledge gap there which causes me not being able to craft such a solution.
6. Another challenge is the pop up panel after a winning appears. I spent some time thinking through the composition of such a modal panel and with the help of AI I figured it out.
